### Release 1.0.6

* ppymilterserver.{Async,Threaded}PpyMilterServer.handle_error: Accept 0
  arguments (besides self); the last exception can (and should) be determined
  independently.

### Release 1.0.5

* Do not sent a response, 'c' (continue) or otherwise, to an 'A' (Abort)
  message; the milter protocol expects no response to 'A'.
  This fixes a bug where ppymilter would confuse the MTA with extraneous 'c'
  (continue) responses after receiving an 'A' (Abort) message, such as when a
  message is discarded and further messages are sent in the same SMTP
  transaction.

### Release 1.0.4

* ppymilterbase.PpyMilterDispatcher now allows an on_error callback to be
  passed, which is called in case of an unhandled exception in the milter.
  This callback must return the value False if it wants the exception to be
  re-raised; otherwise, such as if None is returned, it is assumed that the
  exception has been handled.
  ppymilterserver.{Async,Threaded}PpyMilterServer invoke their own (new)
  handle_error methods via this facility; override them to define your own
  catch-all exception handling for your milter.

### Release 1.0.3

* ppymilterbase.PpyMilterDispatcher, ppymilterserver.{Async,Threaded}PpyMilter-
  Server now allow an arbitrary context argument to be passed, which is passed
  to milter_class.__init__. This facility may be used to pass options or shared
  state.

### Release 1.0.2

* ppymilterserver.AsyncPpyMilterServer: Arbitrary socket support, map support:
  Alternatively to a TCP port number, ppymilterserver.AsyncPpyMilterServer
  constructor now accepts arbitrary socket info in (family, address) tuple
  format, either (socket.AF_INET, (host, port)) for TCP sockets or
  (socket.AF_UNIX, socket_path) for UNIX domain sockets. Also constructor now
  accepts an optional socket/channel map argument for use by asyncore.
* Strip \0 byte terminator from OnHeader value argument.
* Use 'ppymilter' logger instead of root logger.
* Use setuptools, not distutils. distutils is obsolete.

### Release 1.0.1

* Fork to GitHub: https://github.com/jmehnle/ppymilter
* Make distribution `setup.py develop` compatible.
  setuptools does not support non-root (non-empty) package names in the
  `package_dir` option when installing the distribution in development mode
  (`setup.py develop` or `pip install --editable`). In order to attain
  "editable" compatibility, move lib/ contents under lib/ppymilter/ and use
  a root (empty) package name in the `package_dir` option.

### Release 1.0

* PpyMilter 1.0 message modification handling has changed and is NOT backwards
  compatible with any previous PpyMilter release:
  ppymilterbase.PpyMilter no longer stores internal state when clients
  call message modification functions (e.g. ChangeHeader, AddRecipient, etc)
  to store up and send at the proper phase in the milter protocol.  Instead
  clients must store this state themselves, register an OnEndBody() function
  and then "return self.ReturnOnEndBodyActions(modification_list)" to
  send all modifications to a message.  See the the ppymilter wiki or the 
  docstring for ppymilterbase.PpyMilter.ReturnOnEndBodyActions() for more 
  info and an example.
